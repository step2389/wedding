    We met on a crisp autumn afternoon, when a simple conversation blossomed into an inseparable friendship.
    Over time, that friendship grew into love, and together we've shared adventures, dreams, and challenges.
    Today, we celebrate not only our love, but also the family and friends who have joined us on this journey.
